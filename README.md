# 3D Mandelbrot Set Projection

## Introduction
I have created a captivating and innovative 3D representation of the Mandelbrot set, a famous mathematical fractal. By projecting the intricate details of the Mandelbrot set into three-dimensional space, I have unlocked a new perspective on this fascinating mathematical object. The resulting visualization is not only visually stunning but also provides a unique perspective on the complex structure and beauty hidden within the Mandelbrot set.

This 3D projection allows viewers to explore the Mandelbrot set in a way that goes beyond the traditional 2D representations. By adding depth to the fractal, one can appreciate the intricate layers and patterns that emerge as they navigate through the 3D space. The use of color and adaptive point sampling enhances the visual appeal, highlighting the fine details and structures that are often overlooked in flat renderings.

This project is a testament to the power of combining mathematics, computer science, and visualization techniques. It showcases how innovative approaches can breathe new life into well-known mathematical objects and make them accessible to a wider audience. The 3D Mandelbrot set projection is not only a captivating visual experience but also an educational tool that can inspire curiosity and appreciation for the beauty of mathematics.

## Detailed Description
The 3D projection of the Mandelbrot set is achieved through a combination of mathematical calculations, adaptive point sampling, and visualization techniques. Here's a detailed breakdown of the process:

1. **Mandelbrot set calculation:**
   - The boundaries of the complex plane and the maximum number of iterations for the Mandelbrot set calculation are defined.
   - For each point in the complex plane, the Mandelbrot set function (z = z^2 + c) is iterated until the point escapes the set or the maximum number of iterations is reached.
   - The number of iterations required for each point to escape the set is stored in a 2D array called `iterations`.

2. **Colorization:**
   - Colors are assigned to each point based on the number of iterations it took to escape the Mandelbrot set.
   - A colormap (in this case, the 'viridis' colormap) is used to map the iteration counts to colors.
   - A brightness boosting technique is applied to enhance the visibility of the fine details near the plane. This is done by calculating the luminance of each color and applying a nonlinear transformation to the colors below a certain brightness threshold.

3. **Depth calculation:**
   - The depth values for each point are calculated based on their color difference from the escape point.
   - In the Mandelbrot set, the escape point is typically defined as the point at which the iteration diverges or "escapes" the set. In this implementation, a point is considered to have escaped the set if its absolute value exceeds a certain escape radius (default is 2).
   - The depth is calculated by measuring the Euclidean distance between each point's color and the color associated with the escape point in the RGB color space.
   - Mathematically, the depth calculation can be expressed as:
     ```
     depth = 1.0 - sqrt((r_point - r_escape)^2 + (g_point - g_escape)^2 + (b_point - b_escape)^2) / sqrt(3)
     ```
     where `r_point`, `g_point`, `b_point` are the red, green, and blue color components of each point, and `r_escape`, `g_escape`, `b_escape` are the color components associated with the escape point.
   - The depth is then scaled logarithmically using the `zoom_level` parameter to emphasize the details and create a sense of depth in the 3D projection.

4. **Adaptive point sampling:**
   - To optimize the rendering performance and highlight the interesting regions of the Mandelbrot set, adaptive point sampling is employed.
   - A threshold value is defined, and only the points whose iteration counts exceed this threshold are selected.
   - This allows for focusing more points on the regions with higher complexity and reducing the number of points in the less interesting areas.

5. **3D point generation:**
   - The 3D points are generated by combining the x and y coordinates of the sampled points with their corresponding depth values.
   - The x and y coordinates are scaled based on the `zoom_level` to control the extent of the fractal in 3D space.

6. **Point cloud rendering:**
   - A point cloud is created using the generated 3D points and their corresponding colors.
   - An octree data structure is utilized for efficient level-of-detail rendering, allowing for faster visualization of large point clouds.
   - The point cloud is rendered using PyVista, a Python library for 3D visualization.
   - The point size, transparency, and rendering parameters are adjusted to enhance the visual appeal of the 3D projection.

By combining these techniques, a stunning 3D projection of the Mandelbrot set is created, revealing its intricate details and structures. The adaptive point sampling and depth calculation allow for focusing on the interesting regions of the fractal while maintaining performant rendering. The colorization and brightness boosting techniques enhance the visual contrast and make the fine details more apparent.
